# Breast Cancer Detection via Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model for breast cancer detection using a dataset containing various tumor characteristics. The aim is to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on features such as clump thickness, cell size uniformity, and other cellular attributes.
